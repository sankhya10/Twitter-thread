Can this article be broken in a twitter thread, how nginx became number 1 webserver or the journey to become #1 webserver etc.

Here is the thread 

The path to NGINX becoming world’s #1 Web ServerA Thread :thread:  (edited) 

\1 34.1% of websites today use nginx, overtaking Apache at 33.2% and Cloudflare Servers at 18.7%

\2 What is nginx?
It is a Swiss Army Knife™ for developers and platform ops teams.NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
\3 NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.
\4 in 2001, NGINX’s original creator Igor Sysoev encountered a challenge the C10k problem as it was called which was handling 10k simultaneous client connections to clients and his web servers were having trouble keeping up with ever‑increasing numbers of requests.
\5 Igor developed an event‑driven architecture that is lightweight, scalable, and powerful and guess what it’s still at the heart of NGINX today
\6These are some of the popular capabilities of NGINX -> reverse proxying, load balancing, traffic shaping, caching, and security controls
\7 In 2019, NGINX was acquired by F5, and the aim of the acquisition was to focus the company’s expansion into modern and cloud‑native application environments.
\8 Nginx’s future is pegged to container orchestration and management and delivery of cloud‑native applications.
\9 Even today as 20 years pass by, NGINX’s open source offerings and community are strong and vibrant. Their commercial offerings offer more scalability, security and management features for enterprises that need this.

We want this process to be as much automated as possible.
